# web-materialize

This is a sample project that demonstrates the integration of materialize css into a common JSF application.

## Current Status
The application includes a landing page with no content but a typical navbar, some links in it and a login page (called from the button in the navbar). The login is a dummy login just used to illustrate some layout functionality.
